# YGS
Paper: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3814889/pdf/1894.pdf

Finally got jellyfish and YGS to work. 

I followed their methods: https://genome.cshlp.org/content/suppl/2013/09/24/gr.156034.113.DC1/Supplemental_Material_Ykmer_ms_SM.pdf

Code: YGS.pl

input files:
- affinis_female_frag_R1.fastq
- affinis_male_frag_R1.fastq
- Daffinis_Male_HiC.20221222.fa

For the plot and analysis, I used a blueprint in R from Yasir Ahmed(in email)

The blue dots are putative Y scaffolds: 6, 10, 11, 31, 33. 31 is the best looking one from this plot.
