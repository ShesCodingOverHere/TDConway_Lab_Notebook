# Known y-linked primer PCR for affinis

 1. Made a primer dilution 3:30 with 3µL primer: 27µL water
 2. Changed amount on PCR spreadsheet to have correct portions for 5 samples

Order: Ladder-1 male-1 female-5 males-5 females

As expected, the y-linked primer only amplified in the male samples. The 5 male sample is darker than the 1 male sample because there is more DNA in the sample.
