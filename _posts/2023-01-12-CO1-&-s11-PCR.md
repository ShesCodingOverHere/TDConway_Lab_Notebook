### DNA Extraction
Steps we did:

#### Cell Lysis
 1. Get ice bucket and chill cell lysis until cold and cloudy (needs 10-20 minutes)
	 1. Grab a tray to hold vials
	 1. Turn on incubators (65°C & 37°C)
 2. Collect affinis males and females from the Dark and Genome lines (**Only need genome line**)
	 2. 1 male, 1 female, 5 males, 5 females, 5 mix from both lines
	 2. Put 1.7mL fly vials on ice
 3. Add 100µL cold, cloudy cell lysis solution to each fly tube
 4. Homogenize each fly for 2-4 seconds with motor-driven pestle
 5. Incubate at 65°C  for 15 minutes --> cool to room temperature

#### RNAse Treatment

 1. Dilute RNAse A
	 1. Want 8mg/mL --> 100mg/mL times XµL = 8mg/mL times 20 samples
	 1. 1.6µL stock in 18.4µL water
 2. Add 1µL of a 1/4th dilution of RNAse A (8mg/mL) to the homogenate
	 2. Mix sample by inverting the tubes 25 times
 3. Incubate at 37°C for 40 minutes --> Cool to room temperature

#### Protein Precipitation

 1. Add 33µL protein precipitation solution to the RNAse-treated cell lysate
	 1. Vortex on high speed for 10 seconds
 2. Place sample on ice for 5 minutes
 3. Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 3 minutes

#### DNA Precipitation

 1. Move supernatant to a new 1.7mL tube containing 100µL isopropanol
	 1. Mix by inverting 50 times
 2. Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 5 minutes
	 2. Discard supernatant
 3. Add 100µL of freshly prepared 70% ethanol
	 3. Invert tube a few times to wash pellet
 4. Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 1 minute
	 4. Discard supernatant
 5. Invert tube on a kimwipe and leave to air dry for 45+ minutes (until fully evaporated)

#### DNA Resuspension

 1. For 1 Fly: Add 20µL of DNA hydration solution; For 5 flies: Add 50µL of DNA hydration solution
 2. Resuspend at room temperature overnight

### PCR

#### Enwettening the Dried Primers

 1. Look on the order sheet for the correct amount of water to add to the tube in µL

#### Mixing the Mixture for PCR

 1. Label all tubes including a negative control
 2. Go to google drive and change the x value in the PCR sheet to number of samples
 3. Make the mega mixture with all the ingredients
 4. Portion the mixture into each of the labelled tubes
 5. Add the DNA to each tube
 6. Run through PCR

### Gel Electrophoresis

 1. Follow the protocol on the wall...


## Gel Results

First 8 and last 2 are CO1. The more left column is s11 primer.

|Number|Primer|Sequence|Amplification|
|--|--|--|--|
| 760 | s11_1326310_F | AAGCACCGTGTACTTCTAAGCAG | M/F |
| 761 | s11_1326310_R | GCTGAAGTTGTTGATGCTGTTG | M/F |

### Summary:
I successfully extracted DNA and amplified sequences via pcr as shown in the gel results. I used CO1 to make sure I at least extracted DNA correctly, because we knew it would amplify. There is also a negative control of water for each primer set(CO1 and s11). The negative controls did not show up, so there was no contamination. Unfortunately, the primer isn't the right primer for the job. 

Why it didn't work: 
	1) Maybe scaffold 11 isn't Y-linked. 
	2) Primers weren't specific enough to the correct region. 

What I will do to check: 

 1. Sequence 1 male and 1 female from the affinis genome line in one direction and blast it against male and female						assemblies
 2. Run a gradient PCR - high temp to low temp to see if maybe amplification happens at a specific temperature.
 3. Run a PCR on the definite y-linked primers
 4. PCR for s6 and 610
