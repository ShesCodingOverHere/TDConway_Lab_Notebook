# _D. afffinis Y Project_
## Big Question: What is the Y?
- What genes are on it???

### Project Steps
1) Assemble male and female genomes
	- Run mummer to align male and female each to _D. pseudoobscura_ as well as to each other
2) Map male and female short reads to male assembly
	- Compare the mean depth
	- For reference: Lab Notebook post "_D. affinis_ Y Start"
3) Show that  putative Y are actually Y
	- Design primers and test
		- Look at lab post "Steps to developing primers"
	- Depth using samtools depth
		- So many plots
4) Map RNA seq to putative Y
5) mtDNA
	- Short reads and long reads variation
